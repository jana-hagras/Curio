# CURIO – Full Stack Marketplace Platform

CURIO is a **Full Stack web platform** that connects **buyers and artisans**.

# Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/curio-fullstack.git
cd curio-fullstack
```

---

# Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend folder:

```bash
cd backend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
node server.js
```

The backend will start and automatically:

* Connect to MySQL
* Create the **CURIO database**
* Create all required tables

---

# Frontend Setup

Open another terminal and navigate to the frontend folder:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the frontend application:

```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will run locally on:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

# node_modules Folder

The `node_modules` folder contains all project dependencies.

This folder is **not included in the repository** because it can be very large.

Instead, it is automatically created by running:

```bash
npm install
```

This command reads the dependencies from `package.json` and downloads them.
